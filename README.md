# TI84-Programs-Collection

This a collection of [TI84-CE](https://education.ti.com/en/products/calculators/graphing-calculators/ti-84-plus-ce-python) programs for the AP Precalculus Exam / SAT. I have gone down a rabbit hole and wasted soooo much time making a huge collection of programs to extend my calculator's functionality with everything I could ever need, so I figured I'd share it.

Note that this collection was designed *for me*, a high school student currently taking AP Precalculus. The programs have been selected and modified according to my personal preferences and knowledge. There is a good chance that you will not find this to be a perfect, one-size-fits-all collection - it's simply what I desire to have on my calculator.

> [!WARNING]
> This is intended as an enhancement to the calculator's functionality, not a cheating tool. Many schools and teachers prohibit or discourage the use of calculator programs, especially on tests. Make sure that you are allowed to use programs for whatever you are doing.

# About

These programs extend the calculator's functionality to simplify many tasks, such as finding complex interest and solving systems of equations. They also include resources like a Pavlov's triangle generator (`BINOMEXP.8xp`) and a unit circle (`UNITCIRC.8xp`). The goal is to help out with math problems where outside help is not available, particularly the AP Precalculus Exam and the SAT Test.

# Usage

You can transfer programs to your calculator using the [TI Connect CE](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw) desktop app on a computer. Each program in this repository is stored as a `.8xp` file, which you can send to the calculator using the app. If you would like to transfer them all, you can select all files in the folder and transfer them all at once.

Feel free to customize this collection, as there are many programs out there (the biggest repository is [ticalc.org](https://www.ticalc.org/pub/)). You can add, remove, or edit programs to better fit your needs. Consider this collection as a mere starting point.

# Credits

Unfortunately, I did not initially intend to publish this collection, so I didn't take much care to leave credits. If I recall correctly, all programs are either created by me (*no need to give credit for those*) or from [ticalc.org](https://www.ticalc.org/pub/)). Some programs have credits within the source code or display them during execution; none of these credits have been removed by me. Note that I have **changed the names** of some of these programs, so locating them online may not be as straightforward as looking up the file name.

I don't recall any of the third-person programs including licenses or anything of the sort, but as some of them are not my programs, I do not have the right to declare their terms of use. While this collection itself is licensed with the GNU terms, the license does not apply to the individual programs.
